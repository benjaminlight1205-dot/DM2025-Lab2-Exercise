      "Napoleon Bonaparte was a **French military and political leader** who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. He was born on the island of Corsica in 1769 and died in exile on the island of Saint Helena in 1821.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Military Genius:** Napoleon is widely regarded as one of history's greatest military commanders. He was known for his innovative tactics, speed of movement, and ability to inspire his troops. He achieved numerous victories, expanding French influence across much of Europe.\n",
      "*   **Rise to Power:** After distinguishing himself in the military, Napoleon seized political power in a coup d'état in 1799, becoming First Consul of France. He then crowned himself Emperor of the French in 1804.\n",
      "*   **The Napoleonic Wars:** His reign was dominated by a series of major conflicts known as the Napoleonic Wars, in which France fought against various European coalitions. He conquered vast territories and reshaped the political map of Europe.\n",
      "*   **The Napoleonic Code:** One of his most enduring legacies is the **Napoleonic Code (or Civil Code)**. This comprehensive legal system standardized French law and influenced legal systems in many other countries, promoting principles like equality before the law and property rights.\n",
      "*   **Reforms in France:** Beyond military and legal reforms, Napoleon also implemented significant administrative, educational, and economic changes in France. He centralized the government, established a national bank, and reformed the education system.\n",
      "*   **Downfall and Exile:** Despite his initial successes, Napoleon's ambition ultimately led to his downfall. His disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 weakened his empire, and he was eventually defeated by a coalition of European powers. He was first exiled to the island of Elba, escaped, and then definitively defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. He was then exiled to the remote island of Saint Helena, where he died.\n",

      "**Why is he important?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Napoleon's impact on history is profound and multifaceted:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Spread of Revolutionary Ideas:** While he became an emperor, Napoleon's conquests helped to spread some of the ideals of the French Revolution, such as nationalism and legal equality, across Europe.\n",
      "*   **Reshaping Europe:** His wars and political maneuvering fundamentally altered the political landscape of Europe, leading to the rise and fall of empires and the eventual emergence of new nation-states.\n",

      "Of course! Here is a comprehensive explanation of who Napoleon Bonaparte was.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Who was Napoleon Bonaparte?\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, **Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821)** was a French military general and statesman who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and became one of the most powerful and influential figures in modern history. He crowned himself **Emperor of the French** in 1804 and built a vast empire that covered much of western and central Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is remembered for being both a military genius and a brilliant, modernizing administrator, but also as an authoritarian ruler whose ambition led to devastating wars that cost millions of lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Aspects of His Life and Career\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Early Life and Rise to Power\n",
      "*   **Origins:** Napoleon was born on the Mediterranean island of **Corsica**, which had only recently become a French territory. This made him something of an outsider in mainland France.\n",
      "*   **Military Education:** He attended military school in France and proved to be a talented and ambitious officer.\n",
      "*   **The French Revolution:** The chaos of the Revolution created opportunities for talented men like Napoleon to rise quickly. He distinguished himself in several key battles, most notably at the Siege of Toulon in 1793, where he used his artillery expertise to defeat royalist rebels.\n",
      "*   **Military Success:** He became a national hero after successful military campaigns in Italy (1796-97), where his innovative tactics and leadership led to stunning victories against the Austrians.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Seizing Power and Becoming Emperor\n",
      "By 1799, the French government (the Directory) was weak and corrupt. Seeing his chance, Napoleon returned from a campaign in Egypt and, in a daring move known as the **Coup of 18 Brumaire**, overthrew the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   He established a new government called the Consulate and made himself **First Consul**, effectively the dictator of France.\n",
      "*   In 1804, believing he needed to secure his power permanently, he crowned himself **Emperor of the French** in a lavish ceremony at Notre-Dame Cathedral.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Major Accomplishments and Reforms (The Napoleonic Era)\n",
      "Napoleon was more than just a general; he was a remarkable administrator who fundamentally reshaped France.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Napoleonic Code:** This is arguably his most lasting achievement. It was a single, unified legal code for all of France. It swept away the old, confusing feudal laws and established principles like:\n",
      "    *   Equality of all male citizens before the law.\n",
      "    *   The right to own private property.\n",
      "    *   Religious freedom.\n",
      "    This code was so influential that it was adopted or used as a model for legal systems in dozens of countries around the world, many of which still use it today.\n",
      "*   **Centralized Government:** He created a strong, efficient, and centralized government, appointing prefects to run every region.\n",
      "*   **Economic Reforms:** He established the **Bank of France** to stabilize the economy and introduced a fairer system of taxation.\n",
      "*   **Education:** He created the *lycées* (state-run secondary schools) to train a new generation of leaders and civil servants based on merit, not birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. The Napoleonic Wars and European Domination\n",
      "From 1803 to 1815, Europe was engulfed in the **Napoleonic Wars**. Napoleon, leading his legendary *Grande Armée*, proved to be a master of strategy and tactics.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Greatest Victory:** His masterpiece was the **Battle of Austerlitz** (1805), where he decisively defeated a larger Russo-Austrian army.\n",
      "*   **Conquest of Europe:** At its peak around 1810, his empire directly or indirectly controlled Spain, Italy, Germany, and Poland. He placed his relatives on the thrones of conquered nations. His only major undefeated enemy was **Great Britain**, which was protected by its powerful navy.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5. Downfall and Exile\n",
      "Napoleon's ambition ultimately led to his downfall. He made three critical mistakes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **The Peninsular War (1808-1814):** His attempt to conquer Spain and Portugal became a long, brutal guerrilla war that drained French resources and manpower.\n",
      "2.  **The Continental System:** He tried to cripple Britain economically by forbidding his allies from trading with them. This backfired, hurting the European economy and causing resentment.\n",
      "3.  **The Invasion of Russia (1812):** This was his fatal error. He invaded Russia with an army of over 600,000 men. The Russians retreated, burning everything in their path (scorched-earth tactics). By the time Napoleon reached a deserted Moscow, his army was starving and freezing. The retreat through the brutal Russian winter was a catastrophe, and he lost over 90% of his army.\n",
      "\n",
      "This disaster shattered the myth of his invincibility. A coalition of European powers (Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Britain) united against him, defeated him, and forced him to abdicate in 1814. He was exiled to the small island of **Elba**.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 6. The Hundred Days and Waterloo\n",
      "In 1815, Napoleon escaped from Elba, returned to France, and rallied the people to his side, beginning a period known as the **Hundred Days**. The European powers quickly reassembled their armies.\n",
      "\n",
      "His final defeat came at the famous **Battle of Waterloo** in June 1815, where he was beaten by a coalition army led by the **Duke of Wellington** (Britain) and **Gebhard von Blücher** (Prussia).\n",
      "\n",
      "He was exiled again, this time to the remote and desolate island of **St. Helena** in the South Atlantic, where he died in 1821.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Napoleon's Legacy: Good vs. Bad\n",
      "\n",
      "Napoleon is a deeply controversial figure because his legacy is a mix of positive and negative impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Good (His Supporters' View):**\n",
      "*   He saved France from the chaos of the Revolution and brought stability.\n",
      "*   The Napoleonic Code remains a foundation of modern civil law.\n",
      "*   He promoted meritocracy (advancement based on talent, not birth).\n",
      "*   He spread revolutionary ideals like equality, religious tolerance, and secular government across Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Bad (His Critics' View):**\n",
      "*   He was a dictator who betrayed the democratic ideals of the Revolution.\n",
      "*   His constant wars led to the deaths of an estimated 3 to 6 million people.\n",
      "*   He was driven by an insatiable ego and lust for power.\n",
      "*   He reintroduced slavery in the French colonies after it had been abolished during the Revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Napoleon Bonaparte was a colossal figure who, for better or worse, ended the feudal era and dragged Europe into the modern age. He was a brilliant military commander, a visionary administrator, and a ruthless tyrant, all at the same time.\n"

      "*   **Ambitious and Powerful:** He wanted France to be the most powerful country in Europe, and he tried to conquer many other countries. This led to a lot of wars.\n",
      "*   **Eventually Defeated:** Even though he was very successful for a long time, he eventually made some mistakes and was defeated in battle. He was sent away to an island, and later died.\n",
      "\n",

For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "\n",
    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
